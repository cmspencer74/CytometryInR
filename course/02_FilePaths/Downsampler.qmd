# Background

Due to trying to keep the overall file size down, I am downsampling to 100 events. For anyone interested in how I did this, this Quarto Markdown Document contains the code needed to repeat the process. 

# Getting Started

Attach the required packages via the `library()` function

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
library(purrr) # CRAN
library(flowWorkspace) # Bioconductor
library(Luciernaga) #DavidRach/Luciernaga
```

## Specify file.path and identify files

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
StorageLocation <- file.path("course", "02_FilePaths", "data")
Existing <- list.files(StorageLocation, pattern=".fcs", full.names=TRUE)
List1 <- Existing[1:2] # 3L Aurora
List2 <- Existing[3:8] # 4L Aurora
```

## Load .fcs files into a GatingSet

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
cs1 <- load_cytoset_from_fcs(List1, truncate_max_range = FALSE, transformation = FALSE)
gs1 <- GatingSet(cs1)

cs2 <- load_cytoset_from_fcs(List2, truncate_max_range = FALSE, transformation = FALSE)
gs2 <- GatingSet(cs2)
```

# Downsample each sample and pass back to the folder

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
walk(.x=gs1, .f=Luciernaga::Utility_Downsample,
 sample.name=c("$PROJ", "GROUPNAME", "TUBENAME"),
 export=TRUE, outpath=StorageLocation,
  subsample=100, subsets="root", inverse.transform=FALSE)

walk(.x=gs2, .f=Luciernaga::Utility_Downsample,
 sample.name=c("$PROJ", "GROUPNAME", "TUBENAME"),
 export=TRUE, outpath=StorageLocation,
  subsample=100, subsets="root", inverse.transform=FALSE)
```

# Conclusion

In the end, we went from having files that were the following size

To ones that were like this:

We will look more at how the Utility_Downsample is constructed during [Week #10](/Schedule.qmd#downsampling-and-concatenation)

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
sessionInfo()
```
